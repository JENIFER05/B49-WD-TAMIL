Write a blog on Difference between document object and window object

In the web development, the document and window objects in JavaScript . 
These two objects are essential to the browser environment and play distinct roles in web development. 
In this blog post, we'll explore the differences between these objects and how they work together to create a 
dynamic and interactive web experience.

Document Object

The document object represents the HTML document displayed in the browser window. It is the root of the HTML document
tree and provides access to all elements and properties of the web page. In other words, the document object represents
the web page itself and everything within it, including images, text, links, and other elements.
The document object is often used to access and manipulate HTML elements through JavaScript. 
For example,
you can use the document object to change the text content of an element, modify its attributes, 
or add or remove elements from the page.

Window Object

The window object, represents the browser window itself. It is the top-level 
object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy and provides access to the browser's methods and properties. 
The window object is responsible for managing the browser's state, including the browser's location, history, and user interactions.
The window object provides a wide range of properties and methods that allow you to interact with the browser window.
For example, 
you can use the window object to open new browser windows, set the size and position of the window
 and even access the user's computer files.

Difference - Document and Window Objects

The main difference between the document and window objects is that the document object represents the HTML document
,while the window object represents the browser window.  the document object is a 
subset of the window object, as it is contained within the window.
While both objects have different roles, they work together to provide a dynamic and interactive web experience.
For example,
the window object can access the document object to modify the HTML elements on the web page.
Similarly, the document object can access the window object to get information about the browser, such 
as the current URL or the dimensions of the browser window.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the document and window objects are two essential objects in web development. 
While the document object represents the HTML document, the window object represents the browser window.
By understanding the differences between these objects and how they work together, you can create powerful and dynamic web applications 
that provide a seamless user experience.
