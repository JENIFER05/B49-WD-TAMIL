Objects and their Internal Representation in JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that allows developers to create complex and dynamic web applications.
 One of the key features of JavaScript is its support for objects, which are used to represent and manipulate 
 data in the form of properties and methods. In this blog, we will get into objects in JavaScript and explore their internal representation.

Objects in JavaScript

In JavaScript, objects are collections of key-value pairs. They are used to represent entities 
in the code that have properties a. Objects can be created using either object literal syntax or
 constructor functions. Here is an example of an object literal

example:
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  email: 'john@example.com'
};

explanation:
In this example, the person object has three properties: name, age, and email. 
The values for these properties are 'John', 30, and 'john@example.com'.

Internal Representation of Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript objects are implemented as unordered collections of properties, 
where each property has a name and a value. These properties can be either data
properties or accessor properties. Data properties contain a value, while accessor 
properties define functions to get or set the value.When an object is created, JavaScript 
allocates a block of memory to store the object's properties. Each property consists of
two parts: a property name (also known as a key) and a property descriptor. The property descriptor contains information
about the property, such as its value, whether it is writable, enumerable, and configurable. 


Conclusion

JavaScript objects are a powerful tool for modeling complex data structures 
and entities in code. Understanding how objects are represented internally 
in JavaScript is essential for writing efficient and effective code. By leveraging the hash table
and prototype chain, developers can create elegant and maintainable code that is easy to read and understand.
