1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2



HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data
between a client and a server over the internet.It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web, 
The latest versions of HTTP are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, which differ in many aspects.
In this blog, we will explore the differences between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.

1.Performance
One of the primary differences between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 is performance. 
*HTTP/1 -  uses a request/response model where each request/response cycle is initiated by the client.
This means that if a webpage has many resources, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files, each of these resources has to be requested separately,
which can cause latency and slow down the page load time.
*HTTP/2 -  uses a multiplexing model that allows multiple requests to be sent and received at the same time. 
This means that all the resources needed to display a webpage can be sent in a single request, which significantly reduces latency and improves the page load time.

2.Header Compression
*HTTP/1 - uses text-based headers, which can be large and consume a lot of bandwidth. This can lead to slower page load times, especially on slow internet connections. 
*HTTP/2 - uses binary headers, which are much smaller and consume less bandwidth. Additionally, HTTP/2 uses header compression, 
which further reduces the size of headers and improves performance.

3.Server Push
HTTP/1 - relies on the client to request all the resources needed to display a webpage. 
This means that some resources may not be requested until the client has received the initial response from the server.
HTTP/2 - supports server push, which allows the server to push resources to the client without waiting for the client to request them. 
This can further improve performance by reducing latency and the number of round trips required to load a webpage.

4.Security
HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 both support encryption using SSL/TLS. However, HTTP/2 requires encryption to be enabled by default, which makes it more secure than HTTP/1.

5.Compatibility
HTTP/2 is backwards-compatible with HTTP/1, which means that older browsers and servers that do not support HTTP/2 can still communicate with those that do. 
However, some features of HTTP/2 may not be available in older browsers.

In conclusion,
 HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 serve the same purpose of transferring data over the internet, 
 HTTP/2 give significant improvements in terms of performance and efficiency compared to HTTP/1. 
 HTTP/2's features such as multiplexing, server push, and header compression make it a more optimized protocol for modern web applications.
 As more websites adopt HTTP/2, users can expect faster load times, improved performance, and a better browsing experience. 
 HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1 in terms of performance, security, and functionality. 
 It reduces latency, improves page load times, and makes the web more secure. While HTTP/1 is still widely used, more and more websites are adopting
 HTTP/2 to provide a better user experience.
